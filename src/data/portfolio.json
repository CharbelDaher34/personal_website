        "bio": "My journey into technology began at university, where I started with absolutely no prior coding knowledge. During my first year, I discovered my passion for programming and quickly dove deep into the world of Artificial Intelligence. I started by taking courses on Coursera, specifically from DeepLearning.AI, which laid the foundation for my understanding of machine learning and neural networks.\n\nTo solidify my knowledge, I adopted a hands-on approach, building numerous projects that challenged me to apply what I was learning. This practical experience proved invaluable as I transitioned into professional roles, starting with internships where I honed my skills in real-world environments.\n\nSince then, I have been on a continuous path of learning and growth. I am constantly exploring new technologies, refining my craft, and pushing the boundaries of what I can build. Today, as an AI Engineer, I combine that initial spark of curiosity with years of dedicated practice to create intelligent, efficient, and impactful software solutions.",
